  <h5> <em> Making mental health a priority on college campuses</em></h5>
    <p>     College is a formative time for young adults, as well as a breeding ground for mental health issues due to stress and pure biology.</p>

      <p>For many students, while they pursue higher education, their mental health often suffers as a consequence. According to the American Psychiatric Association, 75 percent of mental illnesses develop before the age of 24.</p>

      <p>People aged 18 to-25 years old have the highest prevalence of any mental illness at 25.8 percent. This is larger than 22.2 percent of the population aged 26-49 years, and only 13.8 percent for people 50 and older, according to<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml"> the National Institute of Mental Health.</a> </p>

      <p>Mental health can affect all facets of a student’s life. Stress and environmental factors may spur mental health problems, yet it can exacerbate how one handles turbulent life events.</p>

      <p> At universities, there must be the creation of, as well as easy access to, mental health resources.</p>

    <p> At the University of Maryland primary mental health services are offered in the to <a href="https://www.counseling.umd.edu"> the Counseling Center </a> located in the Shoemaker building.</p>

      <p> “Signing up for an appointment was easy, and the psychiatrist got to me immediately. The treatment was not amazing, but for the price it makes sense,” said junior, psychology and journalism major Julia Gastwirth.</p>

      <p> Shoemaker Building (picured above) is where the Counseling Center has their offices. The Counseling Center is located on the first floor as well as into the basement. </p>

       <p>The process of receiving counseling assessment starts with an intake appointment. During the appointment an evaluation of the appropriate next steps are determined.</p>

      <p> “While the counselors that work at the counseling center can be of great help to students who are struggling, the wait list to schedule an appointment is often long. They do not schedule intake appointments more than two weeks in advance,” senior, peer counselor Danielle Frey said.</p>

    <p>Long wait times create an obstacle to obtaining help. It should be noted that emergency appointments are available upon request.</p>

  <p> According to Associate Director and Staff Psychologist Theodore Pickett, there are approximately 21 counselors who see students. To put this in perspective, that is 21 counselors for an undergraduate student-body of around 31,000. This is around one counselor per around 1,476 students, an exemplification of the lack of mental health resources.</p>

  <p>“Saw around 2,900 students last school year, 21 people cannot give individual therapy to all,” Pickett said. “Goal is to provide, not individual therapy to all, but rather to provide what we can provide.”</p>

  <p>Pickett says that the Counseling Center promotes the idea that there are other resources besides individual therapy. He says that some problems can be addressed through group sessions or through peer counselors at The Help Center.</p>

  <p>“When we’re in distress the first person we go to doesn’t always have to be a therapist, generally go to family and friends, and sometimes that is all you need,” Pickett said. </p>

     <p>However, the debate of this is that, should a university be equipped to handle the mental health needs of students through any measures, even if that is individual therapy? </p>

     <p>“If the university really prioritized mental health, the counseling center would be stacked with staff to help students,” Frey said.</p>

     <p>The Counseling Center, as an institution is good in theory, according to Frey, but is in need of bolstering from not only the university administration, but also the student-body as a whole.</p>

      <p>Campus-wide public discussion and education of mental health are a start.</p>

      <p>Tackling the stigma of mental health is a step in improving and increasing those who receive mental health care as it prevents people from receiving treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>

      <p>Pickett has said that in general mental health fields have worked to reduce stigma over the last 20 years and have done a great job. He says that explains partly why we have had this increase in demand for counseling centers, and a large number of students having had prior therapy before, according to the <a href="https://www.counseling.umd.edu/global/docs/aboutus/annualreport.pdf"> annual University of Maryland Counseling Center Report</a></p>

          <p>He says that now stigma must be reduced in certain niche groups such as race, international students and LGBT groups.
          </p>
      <p>For a strong, positive mental health on college campuses, there must be actual investment in the topic of mental health, both in administration and student body, and not just a service provided by the university to check a box.</p>
